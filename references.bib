	abstract = {Pythagoreanism - Pythagoreanism - Metaphysics and number theory: According to Aristotle, number speculation is the most characteristic feature of Pythagoreanism. Things “are” number, or “resemble” number. To many Pythagoreans this concept meant that things are measurable and commensurable or proportional in terms of number—an idea of considerable significance for Western civilization. But there were also attempts to arrange a certain minimum number of pebbles so as to represent the shape of a thing—as, for instance, stars in a constellation that seem to represent an animal. For the Pythagoreans even abstracted things “have” their number: “justice” is associated with the number four and with a square, “marriage” with the},

	abstract = {Pythagoreanism can be defined in a number of ways., (1) Pythagoreanism is the philosophy of the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras (ca. 570 – ca. 490 BCE), which prescribed a highly structuredway of life and espoused the doctrine of metempsychosis(transmigration of the soul after death into a new body, human oranimal)., (2) Pythagoreanism is the philosophy of a group of philosophers activein the fifth and the first half of the fourth century BCE, whomAristotle refers to as “the so-called Pythagoreans” and towhom Plato also refers. Aristotle’s expression, “so-calledPythagoreans,” suggests both that at his time this group ofthinkers was commonly called Pythagoreans and, at the same time, callsinto question the actual connection between these thinkers andPythagoras himself. Aristotle ascribes no specific names to thesePythagoreans, but the philosophy which he assigns to them is verysimilar to what is found in the fragments of Philolaus of Croton (ca. 470-ca. 390 BCE). Thus, Philolaus and his successorEurytus are likely to have been the most prominent of thesePythagoreans. Philolaus posits limiters and unlimiteds as firstprinciples and emphasizes the role of number in understanding thecosmos. Aristotle also identifies a distinct group of these so-calledPythagoreans who formulated a set of basic principles known as thetable of opposites. Plato’s sole reference to Pythagoreans citestheir search for the numerical structure of contemporary music and isprobably an allusion to Archytas (ca. 420-ca. 350 BCE), who is the first great mathematician in thePythagorean tradition. Starting from the system of Philolaus hedeveloped his own sophisticated account of the world in terms ofmathematical proportion., (3) Many other sixth-, fifth- and fourth-century thinkers are labeledPythagoreans in the Greek tradition after the fourth century BCE. Bythe late fourth century CE many of the most prominent Greekphilosophers including Parmenides, Plato and Aristotle come to becalled Pythagoreans, with no historical justification. There arenonetheless a number of thinkers of the fifth and fourth century BCE,who can legitimately be called Pythagoreans, although often little isknown about them except their names. The most important of thesefigures is Hippasus. What criterion should be used to identify anearly figure as a Pythagorean is controversial and there is debateabout individual cases. Fourth-century evidence shows thatPythagoreanism gave an unusually large role to women for an ancientphilosophhical school. It is likely that the Pythagorean communitiesthat practiced a way of life that they traced back to Pythagoras diedout in the middle of the fourth century BCE. , (4) The last manifestation of Pythagoreanism, Neopythagoreanism, hasbeen the most influential. Neopythagoreanism is not a unified schoolof thought but rather a tendency, stretching over many centuries, toview Pythagoras, with no historical justification, as the central andoriginal figure in the whole Greek philosophical tradition. ThisPythagoras is often thought to have received his philosophy as adivine revelation, which had been given even earlier to wise men ofthe ancient Near East such as the Persian Magi, the Hebrews (Moses inparticular), and the Egyptian priests. All Greek philosophy afterPythagoras, insofar as it may be true, is seen as derived from thisrevelation. Thus, Plato’s and Aristotle’s ideas are viewedas derived from Pythagoras (with the mediation of other earlyPythagoreans). Many pseudepigrapha are produced in later times inorder to provide the Pythagorean “originals” on whichPlato and Aristotle drew. Some strands of the Neopythagorean traditionemphasize Pythagoras as master metaphysician, who supposedlyoriginated what are, in fact, the principles of Plato’s latermetaphysics, the one and the indefinite dyad. Other Neopythagoreanscelebrate Pythagoras as the founder of the quadrivium ofmathematical sciences (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music),while still others portray him as a magician or as a religious expertand sage, upon whom we should model our lives. Neopythagoreanismprobably began already in the second half of the fourth century BCEamong Plato’s first successors in the Academy, but particularlyflourished from the first century BCE until the end of antiquity.Neopythagoreanism has close connections to Middle and Neoplatonism andfrom the time of Iamblichus (4th c. CE) is largely absorbed intoNeoplatonism. It was the Neopythagorean version of Pythagoreanism thatdominated in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.},
